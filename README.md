# BadgerDigitalMetaAdapt
# - Badger Digital Metaverse Standardization for ETH NFTs -
# Badger Digital sets to standardize NFTs in an easy to read, sort, and verify format for development use.
# Badger Digital identifies the lack of traditional formatting in NFTs as a root issue in mass adaptation.
# Game or App developers simply cannot utilize NFTs on a large scale with so many varitions and definitions of what an NFT is.
# Follow the example file formatting to adapt your NFT collection to be included in the BadgerDigitalMetaAdapt repository for developer use.
# Badger Digital does not seek to "centralize" or otherwise regulate what NFTs are eligible for adaptation, but rather simply provide the tools
# and resources neccesary for NFT creators to standardize their collections for mass adaptation into real world markets.
# Please head to BadgerNFT.net for any further questions or information regarding BadgerDigitalMetaAdapt Repository.
